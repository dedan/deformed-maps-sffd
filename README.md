# SFFD response time cartogram

I wanted to create a map that is deformed by the average response time of ambulances in this neighborhood. Areas of high resonse times where supposed to become larger. This unfortunately does not work so far.

## how to get it running

* run `make all` to download all the data
* start a webserver, e.g.: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
* and then opoen the index.html
